Hello and welcome to Section 2 getting set up in this section you're going to get your local environment

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,110
set up for the rest of the course whether you're on OSX Linux or Windows will be installing node and

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,860
looking at exactly how we can run node applications.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,120
We're going to talk about what node is and why you'd ever want to use it why you would want to use no.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:28,620
As opposed to something like Rails C++ Java or any other language that can accomplish similar tasks.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,700
At the end you will be running your very first node application.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,630
It's going to be simple but it is going to get us down that path towards creating real world production

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,160
node apps which is the end goal of this course.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,160
Let's dive right in.

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,420
