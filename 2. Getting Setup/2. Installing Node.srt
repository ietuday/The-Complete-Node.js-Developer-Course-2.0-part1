1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,950
It before we started talking about what note is and why it's useful.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,880
Which I'm sure you are wondering.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,890
We're going to go ahead and install node on your machine because in the next couple of videos as I aim

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,340
to answer those questions we're going to want to run a little bit of node code now to get started in

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,160
this video we just need two programs a browser.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,020
I'm going to be using Chrome throughout the course but any browser will do.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:31,680
And in the terminal sometimes known as the command line on Linux or the command prompt on Windows.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,050
Let's go ahead and open that up right now.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,930
I'm going to use Spotlight to open up the terminal which is what it's known as on my operating system.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,800
If you're on Windows look for something like the command prompt you can search using the Windows key

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,070
and then by typing.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,420
And on Linux you're looking for something called the command line.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,830
Although depending on your distribution it might be called the terminal or command prompt.

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,620
Now once you have that program open you're going to see something a little daunting.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,550
It's a screen.

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,210
Yours probably has a black background with white text.

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,950
And essentially it's waiting for you to run a command.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,180
We're going to be running quite a few commands from the terminal throughout the course and then around

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,460
four or five videos.

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,170
I'm going to give you a crash course.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,370
So if you've never used this before you can start navigating comfortably.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,600
But for now you don't need to worry about any of that.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,160
We're not going to run any commands for the moment in the browser.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,830
We can head over to node j ass dot org to grab the installer for the latest version of Node.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,570
Hey this is Andrew from the future with a quick update.

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,990
As you saw on the previous screen when this course was first created node version 6 was the latest version

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,140
of node available.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,280
As you can clearly see these days that's no longer the case.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,140
The latest version now is version 10.

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,560
I've updated the course to support version 10 and you're going to have to actually install the 10 of

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,170
node or greater in order to work through the entire class as new node versions come out.

32
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,970
New features are added to the language and if you're using an older version of node you're not going

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,450
to be able to work through the class since it was updated to cover these awesome new features.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:19,290
So long story short make sure you are using node the 10 as seen here or greater if you are going to

35
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,770
be able to move through the entire class with no problems.

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,160
All right that's it for this little interruption.

37
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,910
Let's get back to the regular video for now though.

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,030
All we have to do is click this button.

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,100
It downloads the installer and the installer is one of those basic click Next a few times and you're

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,560
done.

41
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,570
Type of installers there's no need to run any fancy commands.

42
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm going to go ahead and start the installer here.

43
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,930
It's just going to ask me a few questions.

44
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,160
Go ahead and click next or continue through all of them.

45
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,290
You might want to specify a custom destination but if you don't know what that means and you don't usually

46
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,240
do it when installing programs that go ahead and skip that step to here I can see I'm using just 47

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,850
megabytes.

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,100
No problem.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,820
I'm going to go ahead and run in the installer by entering my password and once I enter my password

50
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,520
it should really only take a couple of seconds to get node installed.

51
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,380
And here you go.

52
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,920
We have a message that says the installation was completed successfully which means we are good to go.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,140
And now that node has been installed successfully we can go ahead and verify that by running it from

54
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,580
the terminal over inside of the terminal.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm going to actually shut it down by going to quit terminal and open it up again.

56
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,270
The reason I'm opening it up is because we've installed a new command and some terminals require a restart

57
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,030
before it's going to be able to run that new command.

58
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,730
In our case we've restarted things and we can run our brand new command.

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:57,120
We're going to type it out just like this node space hyphen the what we're doing here is we're running

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,850
the node command and we're passing it what's called a flag.

61
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,650
This is a hyphen sign followed by a letter could be a it could be J or in our case it's v.

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,370
This is going to print the version of node currently installed.

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,590
We might get an error.

64
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,180
Like this if you try to run a command that doesn't exist like A.D SDF you'll see.

65
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,650
Command not found.

66
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,750
If you see that it usually means the node installer didn't work correctly or you haven't ran it in the

67
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,040
first place.

68
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,070
In our case though a running node with the the flag should result in a number in our case it's version

69
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,190
six point two point two.

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,390
Once again make sure that you have a V-6 version of node installed.

71
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,920
Otherwise a lot of the videos throughout the course just aren't going to work if you do have node installed

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,550
and you're seeing something like what I see here then you are done.

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,110
I'll see you next time where we start exploring exactly what node is.

74
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,880
Stay tuned.

75
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,510
I will see you then.
