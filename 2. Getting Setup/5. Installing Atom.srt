00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,340
In this video I want to take a quick moment to give you a tour of the various text editors you can use

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,690
for this course.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,270
If you already have one you love using you can stop watching now because you can keep using the one

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,680
you have.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,560
There's no need to switch editors to get anything done in this course.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,240
Now if you don't have one and you're looking for a few options I always recommend using Adam which you

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,030
can find that Adam and I know it's free open source and it's available on all operating systems.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,680
Linux OSX and Windows.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,350
It's created by the folks behind get hub and it's the editor that I'm going to be using inside of this

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,170
course.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,190
There's an awesome community of theme and plug in developers.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,120
So you really can customize it to your liking.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,860
Now aside from Adam there are a few other options.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,900
I've heard a lot of people talking about Visual Studio code and they've been wondering why I don't use

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,060
in my courses I don't have any hands on experience with it but it does look pretty appealing at first

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,820
glance.

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,670
It is also open source free and it's available on all operating systems.

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,290
If you don't like Adam I highly recommend checking this out because I've heard so many good things via

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,820
word of mouth.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,550
Next up we always have Sublime Text which you can find out sublime at text dot com.

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:18,160
Now Sublime Text is not free and it's not open source but it's a text editor that a lot of folks do

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,260
enjoy using.

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,220
I prefer Adam because it's very similar to sublime tax.

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,680
Though I find it snappier and easier to use.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,270
Plus it's free and open source.

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,350
Now if you are looking for a more premium editor with all of the bells and whistles in ID as opposed

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:38,260
to a text editor I always recommend jet brains none of their products are free though they do come with

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,310
a 30 day free trial but they really are the best tools of the trade.

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,320
Do you find yourself in a corporate setting or you're out of a job where the company is willing to pay

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,410
for a editor.

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,290
I always recommend going with Jepp Raines all of their editors come with all of the tools you'd expect

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,150
like version control integration debugging tools and deploying tools built in.

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,770
Now it's definitely overkill for this course but I wanted to make you aware that they exist so down

34
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,160
the line you always have that choice.

35
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,070
As I said before in this course I'm going to be using atom.

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,280
I highly recommend it.

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,150
It has everything we need to create node apps.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,980
So take a moment download the one you want to use.

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,960
Play around with it.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,140
Make sure it fits your needs.

41
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,820
If not try another one.

42
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,290
When you're happy with one you can move on to the next video where we're going to create our very first

43
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,340
node application.

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,630
A really simple hello world example.

45
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,850
So stay tuned.

46
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,650
I will see you next time.
