00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,200
In this video you are going to be creating and running your very first node app while it will be a simple

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,510
one it's going to demonstrate the entire process from creating files to running them from the terminal.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,530
The first step is going to be to create a folder.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,030
Every project we create is going to live inside of its own folder.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,470
I'm going to open up the finder on OSX and navigate to my desktop.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,510
What I'd like you to do is open up the desktop on your OS whether you're on Linux or Windows or OSX

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,450
and create a brand new folder called Hello world.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,940
Now I'm using capitalization on both the H and W..

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,840
You could also go with something like this.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,470
Hello hyphen world.

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,660
Let's go ahead and use this option.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,200
Hello hyphen world.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,350
In a lower case i don't recommend using spaces in your project file or folder names as it only makes

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,060
it more confusing to navigate inside of the terminal.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,980
Now we have this hello world folder and we can open it up inside of our editor.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,460
Here I use command 0 to open up and I'm going to navigate to the desktop and a double click my hello

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,370
world folder on the left I have my files which are none.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,380
Let's go ahead and create a new one.

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to make a new file in the root of the project and we're going to call this one app dot J.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes this is going to be the only file we have inside of our node application.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,700
And then here we can write some code that's going to get executed when we start the app in the future

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,510
we'll be doing crazy stuff like initializing databases and starting web servers.

23
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:36,140
But for now we're simply going to use cons. dialogue which means we're accessing the logged property

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,790
on the console object.

25
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,520
It's a function.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,660
So we can call it with parentheses.

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,410
And we're going to pass in one argument a string Hello world.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,260
I'm going to toss a semi-colon on the end and save the file.

29
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,990
This is going to be the first app we run.

30
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,120
Never remember there is a basic javascript requirement for this course so nothing here should look too

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,110
foreign to you.

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,330
I'll be covering everything new and fresh inside of this course but the basics.

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,400
Creating variables calling functions those should be something you're already familiar with.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,700
Now that we have our out Jeff's file the only thing left to do is run it and we're going to do that

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,410
over in the terminal.

36
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,860
Now to run this program we have to navigate into our project folder.

37
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,450
If you're not familiar with the terminal I'll give you a quick refresher.

38
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:30,650
You can always figure out where you are using P.W. D on Linux or OSX or the dirty command on Windows

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,200
when you run it you're going to see something like this.

40
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:39,770
I'm in the Users folder and then I'm in my user folder and my user name happens to be Andrew.

41
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,300
When you open the terminal or the command prompt you're going to star in your user directory.

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,620
We can use C-D to navigate into the desktop.

43
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,610
And here we are.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,190
Now we're sitting in the desktop.

45
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,630
The other command you can run from anywhere on your computer is forwards slash user's forwards slash

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,450
Andrew forward slash desktop.

47
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,900
This is going to navigate to your desktop no matter what folder you're located in the command up above

48
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,590
a CD desktop requires you to be in the user directory to work correctly.

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,840
Now that we're here though we can start by seeding into our project directory which we called Hello

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:25,180
hi hyphen world and once we're in here we can run in the ls command on Linux or Mac which is the dirk

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,100
command on windows to see all of our files.

52
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,290
And in this case we just have one we have app.

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,770
DOT.

54
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,320
J.S..

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,930
This is the file We're going to run.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,540
Now before you do anything else make sure you see what I see here.

57
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,830
You should be in the hello world folder and you should have the app.

58
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,220
JS file inside.

59
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,380
If you do all we're going to do is run the node command followed by a space so we can pass in an argument

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,940
and that argument is going to be the file name app dot.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,550
Yes once you have this in place you go ahead and hit enter and there we go hello world prints to the

62
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,870
screen and that is all it takes to create and run a very basic node application.

63
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,020
While our app doesn't do anything cool we're going to be using this process of creating folders files

64
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,640
and running them from the terminal throughout the course so it's a great start on our way to making

65
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,480
real world node apps.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,340
That is it for this video and that is it for this section.

67
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,890
We took a look at what node is why it's cool and you created your very first application and the next

68
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,670
section we're going to dive in creating our first app.

69
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,160
I am super excited to start writing real world applications.

70
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,240
So stay tuned.

71
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,840
I will see you next time
