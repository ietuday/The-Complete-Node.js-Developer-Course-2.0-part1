Welcome to the Course First up thanks for joining.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,000
I am super excited to show you everything that Noad can do.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,690
I packed this course with a ton of content projects challenges and real world examples all designed

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,580
to teach you know by doing this means you'll be getting your hands dirty early on in the next section.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,110
Writing some code and you're going to be writing code for every project this is not one of those copy

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,910
and paste courses you'll be writing every line of code that powers our applications.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,440
Now all of these projects are a ton of fun to build and they were designed to teach you everything required

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,690
to launch your own node app from planning to development and testing to deploying.

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,830
Now as you do launch these applications and move through the course you are going to run into errors.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,320
It's just going to happen.

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,520
Maybe something doesn't install as expected.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,440
Or maybe you try to run an app and instead of getting the expected output you get a really long obscure

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,100
error message.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,260
Either way I am here to help.

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,730
At the bottom of every video you can find a link called Q&amp;A.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,010
This is going to link you to the Q and A section for that video.

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,220
You'll be able to find other questions asked by other students and you'll be able to ask your own question.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,610
So if you get stuck post there and I'll get back to you right away.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,300
Let's go ahead and dive into the first section.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,470
Well you'll learn what note is why it's useful and you're going to write your first app.

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,350
That's coming up next.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,350
So let's get to it.
